Create your HTML and CSS to position your square shape. These will be the colors that are randomly seleced for the game
	green			red
		start button
	blue 			yellow

Randomly select a square and fade that color in then out
	JS random select and light up

Allow the user to click the square that was selected
	user click and build on empty array

Continue randomly selecting colored square shapes adding the new random selection to be added to the previous selection. Eventually you will end up with a random dequence of selected colors

Each time a new color is added to the sequence allow the user to ener (click) the sequence in the order that it was played

If the user continues to get the order correct then proceed to adding another color to the collection until the user gets the order incorrect keep track of how many rounds the usre is able to go
