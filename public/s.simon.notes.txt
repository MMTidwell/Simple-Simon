	√ - Create your HTML and CSS to position your square shape. 
	- Randomly select a square and fade that color in then out
	- Allow the user to click the square that was selected
	- Continue randomly selecting colored square shapes adding the new random selection to be added to the previous selection. Eventually you will end up with a random sequence of selected colors
	- Each time a new color is added to the sequence allow the user to enter (click) the sequence in the order that it was played
	- If the user continues to get the order correct then proceed to adding another color to the collection until the user gets the order incorrect keep track of how many rounds the user is able to go
