Notes - 
	√ - Create your HTML and CSS to position your square shape. 
	- Randomly select a square and fade that color in then out
	- Allow the user to click the square that was selected
	- Continue randomly selecting colored square shapes adding the new random selection to be added to the previous selection. Eventually you will end up with a random sequence of selected colors
	- Each time a new color is added to the sequence allow the user to enter (click) the sequence in the order that it was played
